Extracting dense flow field given a video.

#### Depencies:
- LibZip: 
to install on ubuntu ```apt-get install libzip-dev``` on mac ```brew install libzip```

#### For OpenCV 3 Users
Please see the [opencv-3.1](https://github.com/yjxiong/dense_flow/tree/opencv-3.1) branch. Many thanks to @victorhcm for the contributions!

1.下载 Download
=
    $ git clone --recursive http://github.com/yjxiong/dense_flow
    
2.安装 Install
=
#### 1.在下载包的目录下执行cmd:
    $ mkdir build 
    
    $ cd build
    
    $ cmake .. 
    
    $ make -j


### Usage
```
./extract_gpu -f test.avi -x tmp/flow_x -y tmp/flow_y -i tmp/image -b 20 -t 1 -d 0 -s 1 -o dir
```
- `test.avi`: input video
- `tmp`: folder containing RGB images and optical flow images
- `dir`: output generated images to folder. if set to `zip`, will write images to zip files instead.

### Warp Flow
The warp optical flow is used in the following paper

To extract warp flow, use the command
```
./extract_warp_gpu -f test.avi -x tmp/flow_x -y tmp/flow_y -i tmp/image -b 20 -t 1 -d 0 -s 1 -o dir
```
